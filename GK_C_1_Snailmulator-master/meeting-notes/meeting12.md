# Meeting 12 - Group [2017-10-08]
- Missing Group Members: None

## Trello Tasks:
- [ ] Set up demo page for database storage.

## Notes:
- ~~@radomski has gotten plugins mostly set up.~~
  - He's going to make a standard for sockets.
  - He had it done, but his hard drive crashed. RIP.
- @lgaynor is having trouble getting the database to function properly.
  - @radomski is gonna help him with that.
  - Given the shortage of time before the demo, we'll be using the provided MySql server until we can get PostgreSQL set up.
- @samw got the website almost completely set up.
- @mblack is almost done getting objects to send to users.
  - He's getting the hang of sockets.
