# Meeting 19 - Group [2017/10/15]
- Missing Group Members: None

## Trello Tasks
- [ ] @radomski is going to finish setting up logins.

## Notes
- @radomski had a good idea for using session variables to set up logins securely.
- @samw is getting rid of the unused ``src`` folder. Apparently @radomski tried several times and it keeps coming back.
- @radomski has been reducing controllers to be useful.
  - Plugins should be gluing the different pieces of our code together.
  - Controllers now accept POST and GET.
