### Team Work
- Give two examples of individual personality differences and how that can affect teamwork.
  1. An introvert could be exhausted by an extrovert's communication.
  2. Cultural differences could cause hurt feelings because of narrow-mindedness or misunderstanding.
- Give two examples of individual cultural differences and how that can affect teamwork.
  1. A high respect for authority could make it difficult for an individual to present or defend their own ideas.
    * This can be handled by being aware of each member's contribution and being patient with someone who tends to be quiet.
  2. One who was used to a strict schooling environment could have difficulties focusing in a not-so-strict learning environment.
    * This can be handled by communicating person-to-person that it's important to focus on things that we are doing and to try to be patient with them.
- What are some social roles that cause problems for the team? How can these situations/roles be handled by the team?
  1. Disrupter
    * Someone who over-socializes rather than engaging in work, which can be resolved similar to the above with lack of focus. Communication privately and trying to draw attention back.
  2. Dominator
    * Someone who over-controls a conversation, and often makes it difficult for others to comment. This can be resolved like everything else - communicating. However, it's also important to be willing to hold your ground and to support those who might not.

### Source Control
- What are the two main reasons that developers need to use a tool like GIT for software development?
  1. Version control.
  2. Collaboration.
-  Is it useful to use GIT in a single person environment? Explain.
  * Yes. It secures changes and makes it easy for versioning of software.
- What is a branch (in a GIT repository)? Describe two scenarios/situations when a branch would need to be created.
  * A branch is a version of the project. Each branch could have different tracked files but they all work off of the original source and are intended to be merged back into the master when complete.
  1. When a user is working on the same file as another user.
